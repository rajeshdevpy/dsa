🚀 Today’s Python Topic:
✅ List Comprehensions + Dictionary Comprehensions (Pro Level Python)

These are very important for:

Clean code

Interviews

Writing professional Python

Data processing

Backend development

🔹 1️⃣ List Comprehension (Basic)
Normal way:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

squares = []
for n in numbers:
    squares.append(n * n)

print(squares)
Pythonic way:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

squares = [n * n for n in numbers]

print(squares)

🔥 Cleaner
🔥 Shorter
🔥 Professional

🔹 2️⃣ With Condition (Very Important)
Get only even numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

evens = [n for n in numbers if n % 2 == 0]

print(evens)

Output:

[2, 4, 6]
🔹 3️⃣ Advanced Condition
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

result = ["Even" if n % 2 == 0 else "Odd" for n in numbers]

print(result)

Output:

['Odd', 'Even', 'Odd', 'Even', 'Odd']

This is commonly asked in interviews.

🔹 4️⃣ Dictionary Comprehension
Normal way:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]

square_dict = {}

for n in numbers:
    square_dict[n] = n * n

print(square_dict)
Professional way:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]

square_dict = {n: n * n for n in numbers}

print(square_dict)

Output:

{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16}
🔹 5️⃣ Real-World Example (Very Important)

Remove empty strings:

names = ["Raj", "", "Amit", "", "Neha"]

cleaned = [name for name in names if name]

print(cleaned)

Output:

['Raj', 'Amit', 'Neha']

Used in:

APIs

Forms

Data cleaning

Backend projects

🎯 Today’s Practice Task (Do This Now)
Task 1:

Create a list from 1 to 20 and:

Store only numbers divisible by 3

Task 2:

Given:

words = ["apple", "banana", "kiwi", "mango"]

Create a dictionary:

Key → word

Value → length of word

Task 3 (Professional Level):

Given:

emails = ["raj@gmail.com", "test@yahoo.com", "admin@gmail.com"]

Create a list that only contains emails from gmail.
