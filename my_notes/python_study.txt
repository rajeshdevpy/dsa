If you’re a 𝗣𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗻 learner, this is for you

• Tutorials make sense… until you code alone
• Errors pop up and confidence drops
• Everyone says “just practice” but no one tells you how

Here’s the simple plan that finally worked for me and can work for you too 👇

𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟬: 𝗙𝗶𝘅 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗯𝗲𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗿 𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗱𝘀𝗲𝘁

- Confusion ≠ failure
- Errors ≠ weakness
- Consistency > talent

👉 60–90 minutes daily is enough. No marathon coding.

𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟭: 𝗣𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗻 𝗕𝗮𝘀𝗶𝗰𝘀 (𝗪𝗲𝗲𝗸 𝟭–𝟮)

Learn:

- Variables & data types
- Input / Output
- Basic operators

Practice ideas:

- Simple calculator
- Temperature converter
- Print patterns

👉 Goal: Understand how Python “thinks”

𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟮: 𝗟𝗼𝗴𝗶𝗰 & 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗹 𝗙𝗹𝗼𝘄 (𝗪𝗲𝗲𝗸 𝟯)

Learn:

- if–else
- loops (for, while)

Practice ideas:

- Even/odd checker
- Number guessing game
- Multiplication tables

👉 Goal: Make decisions with code

𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟯: 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗦𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲𝘀 (𝗪𝗲𝗲𝗸 𝟰)

Learn:

- Lists
- Dictionaries
- Sets & tuples

Practice ideas:

- Student marks system
- Phonebook using dictionary
- Find highest/lowest score

👉 Goal: Store & manage data confidently

𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟰: 𝗙𝘂𝗻𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 (𝗪𝗲𝗲𝗸 𝟱)

Learn:

- Writing your own functions
- Parameters & return

Practice ideas:

- Calculator using functions
- Password strength checker
- Simple quiz app

👉 Goal: Write clean, reusable code

𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟱: 𝗠𝗶𝗻𝗶 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀 (𝗪𝗲𝗲𝗸 𝟲)

Build at least 2:

- To-Do List (CLI)
- ATM simulation
- Text-based game

Even messy projects count. Push them to GitHub.

Save this 👇

● I can write basic Python without fear
● I understand errors instead of panicking
● I’ve solved 30–40 problems
● I built 2 mini projects
● I can explain my code in simple words

If yes → you’re no longer a beginner.

⚠️ Biggest mistake beginners make

Jumping to AI / ML / Data Science
before learning logic + confidence

Python first. Speed later.
