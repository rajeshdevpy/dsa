In python we havce 2 type of data structures
1. Built In:
    List (Ordered, Indexed, not hashable, Good for different operations like removing and adding new elements)
    Tuple (Ordered, Indexed, hashable, Used for stop accidental changes)
    Dict(Ordered, Key --> Only allowed which is hashable, mostly immutable data types)
    Set(Unordered, Used for perform set operations, Only hashable elements are allowed)

2. User Defined 
    stack  (LIFO--> Last In First Out, FILO--> First In Last Out)
    queue (FIFO--> First In First Out)
    linked List
    Graph
    Tree
